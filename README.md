Basic Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ouseful-demos/getting-started-with-notebooks/master)

These notebooks were originally produced for an in-reach project on Jupyter notebooks, hosted on Azure notebooks. A lot of things may have rotted since I last looked at them and as required packages have moved on...

## Running the Notebooks

There are a lot of required packages that aren't installed if you want to run all the notebooks. I'll try to get around to producing a Binder setup that stands a chance of running some of the notebooks at least when I get a chance...  *UPDATE: the `fullbinder` branch has a Binder config that will try to install everything. I'm pondering smaller topic specific builds that work for particular topic notebooks...*

*More Binder links to follow with topical Binders for running subsets of the notebooks... *
