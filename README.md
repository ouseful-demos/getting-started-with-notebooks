# getting-started-with-notebooks

*Binder link to follow... the `fullbinder` branch has a Binder config that will try to install everything. I'm pondering smaller topic specific builds that work for particular topic notebooks...*

These notebooks were originally produced for an in-reach project on Jupyter notebooks, hosted on Azure notebooks. A lot of things may have rotted since I last looked at them and as required packages have moved on...

There is likely to be a lot of required packages that aren't installed. I'll try to get around to producing a Binder setup that stands a chance of running some of the notebooks at least when I get a chance...
